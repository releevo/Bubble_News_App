## Your Bubble

With the current algorithms used by social media sites and the closed nature of many netowrks, you can often find yourself in a bubble - seeing only one side to any given story or news article.

Bubbles App hopes to ameliorate this and give you both perspectives on any given story. This will allow you to make an informed decision on trending news topics.

## Overview of the App

Users can sign up and add a new story of a topic they wish to discuss.  This will use a google search to find an article relevant to your story.  Once you select the initial article this will send a notification to users who are interested in the same topics related to your story.

Those who have received a notification will have the option to add an article from an opposing view and/or comment to create a discussion.

Users who are logged in who view the story (and didn't receive a notification) are also able to add opposing articles. All stories can be accessed by the homepage.

Once completed by the addition of the second article, discussion will hoepfully be generated to obtain a full overview of your chosen topic.

## Database

The creation of this app required 10 tables to be created to allow the topics, users, notifications, stories and artciles to be intertwined. This required the team to work closely together to ensure all required data was present for all sections of the app.

## Future Directions

- Add email notifications.
- React front end.
- Allow articles to be replaced if a better one is supplied - to be determined by votes.
- Ability to add an article from hard drive in addition to google search.
- Ability for user to update profile and display name.
